This repository is still pre-release. There are a few show stopping known issues. The following describes expected experience for each functionality in the example project:

### Wallet Adapter
* [x] Authorize
* [x] Reauthorize
* [x] Deauthorize
* [x] Sign Transaction
* [x] Sign & Send Transaction
* [ ] Sign Message: WIP

### Seed Vault
Currently, there is an integration in code but it has not yet been externalized to the example app.

## Running the example project
A proper written manual is in the works but for now you can refer to this video:
